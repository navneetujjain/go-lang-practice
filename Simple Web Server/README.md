# Simple Web Server

This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic web server using the Go programming language. It is a lightweight and minimal server designed to handle HTTP requests and responses efficiently.

## Features

- Serves static HTML content.
- Handles basic HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
- Simple and easy-to-understand codebase for beginners to learn Go and web server concepts.

## Requirements

- Go (Golang) installed on your system (minimum version: 1.16).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/navneetujjain/go-lang-practice.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
  ```bash
  cd "Simple Web Server"
  ```

3. Run the server:
   
  ```bash
  go run main.go
  ```

## Usage

1. Launch the server as mentioned above.
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified in the code).
3. Interact with the server to see the response.

## File Structure

- `main.go`: The core file containing the server implementation.
- `static/`: Directory containing static files (HTML, CSS, JS) served by the web server.
